# Statistical models for data analysis
In this project, we used the "2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro" dataset from Kaggle to demonstrate the process of analyzing data using different methods and tools. The project consists of five parts, each building on the previous one.

# part 1
In part 1, the dataset was pre-processed, and descriptive statistics and distribution of numeric variables were shown. Categorical variables were analyzed using histograms and boxplots, and missing values were reported. Three research questions were formulated for later use in the project.

# part 2
Part 2 examined one of the research questions from part 1 using hypothesis tests such as T-test, F-test, and Wald test. Confidence intervals were also created for the variables in the research question and its theory was demonstrated.

# part 3
In part 3, linear and logistic regression models were implemented. The beta vector, ANOVA table, R-squared, and R-adj were calculated, and statistical tests were used to examine the beta vector and confidence intervals. Residual graphs were used to check if the linear model assumptions were reasonable, and interaction models were compared to find the better model. Regression Stepwise Backward/Forward was used to choose the best model.

# part 4
In part 4, the bootstrap method was demonstrated on linear regression using the same research question from part 3. Bootstrap was used to create confidence intervals for beta estimators and new observations based on quantile, pivotal confidence interval, and confidence interval based on the normal approximation. Permutation tests and Wald tests were also examined.

# part 5
In part 5, Bayesian methods were used to calculate the log ratio, while trying different kinds of priors and calculating the posterior. Different methods of dealing with missing data such as mutation regression imputation, multiple imputation, and IPW were demonstrated, and the methods were compared.

# Summary
In this project, we learned how to preprocess data, formulate research questions, conduct hypothesis tests, implement linear and logistic regression, use the bootstrap method, Bayesian methods, and deal with missing data. We also demonstrated the use of various statistical tools and techniques such as ANOVA table, residual graph, confidence intervals, and interaction models. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive overview of statistical models for data analysis.
